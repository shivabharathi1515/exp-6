        Measurement of Capacitance by Schering Bridge  
AIM:
To Determine the Capacitance of an unknown Capacitor.
APPARATUS REQUIRED:
virtual labs
THEORY:
 
Let,
C1=capacitor whose capacitance is to be measured.
r1= a series resistance representing the loss in the capacitor C1.
C2= a standard capacitor.
R3= a non inductive resistance.
C4= a variable capacitor.
R4= a variable non inductive resistance.
At balance,
(r_1+1/(jωC_1 ))*(R_4/(jωC_4 R_4+1))=R_3/(jωC_2 )……(1)
r_1 R_4-(jR_4)/(ωC_1 )=-(jR_3)/(ωC_2 )+(R_3 R_4 C_4)/C_2 ……(2)
r_1=R_3*C_4/C_2 ……(3)
C_1=R_4*C_2/R_3 ……(4)
D_1=ωC_1 r_1……(5)
PROCEDURE:
 
1) Apply Supply voltage from the signal generator with arbitrary frequency. ( V =3v). Also set the unknown Capacitance value from 'Set Capacitor Value' tab.
2) Then switch on the supply to get millivoltmeter deflection.
3) Choose the values of C2, C4, R3 and R4 from the capacitance and resistance box. Varry the values to some particular values to achieve "NULL".
4) Observe the millivoltmeter pointer to achieve "NULL".
5) If "NULL" is achieved, switch to 'Measure Capacitor Value' tab and click on 'Simulate'. Observe the calculated values of unknown capacitance (C1) and it's internal resistance (r1).
6) Also observe the Dissipation factor of the unknwown capacitor which is defined as

ω*C*r" " Where,ω=2πf

CASE 1:
 
CALCULATION:
The current voltmeter reading is: 0.0498638641
Capacitor value (in uF): 28.799
Resistance value (in Ω): 35.786
Dissipation Factor: 3.2361
RESULT:
Thus the measurement of capacitance by schering bridge is validated and verified using virtual labs
